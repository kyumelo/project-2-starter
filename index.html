            <p> LOONA is a South Korean girl group formed by a company called BlockBerry Creative. In total, LOONA had 12 members: HeeJin, HyunJin, HaSeul, YeoJin, ViVi, Kim Lip, JinSoul, Choerry, Yves, Chuu, Go Won, and Olivia Hye. The group officially debuted as a full team in 2018 with the song “Hi High.” LOONA quickly gained attention for their powerful performances, beautiful visuals, and storytelling in their music videos. 
                Fans have culminated a theoretic universe in which the girls reside, called The LOONAVERSE.
                Over time, the group faced some challenges with their management company. In 2023, most of the members left the company and began new projects.

        The members are split into three sub-units—LOONA 1/3, Odd Eye Circle, and yyxy—each representing different dimensions, emotions, or parts of the universe. The storyline involves time loops, alternate realities, and symbolism like mirrors, moons, and animals. Fans have come up with their own theories stemming from these ideas. The girls exist in different timelines or worlds but are all drawn to each other, often trying to reunite or cross boundaries to find one another. The butterfly is a recurring image representing transformation and freedom, while the moon often symbolizes guidance or fate. There was never a confirmed storyline as most of the information is given from visuals from the music videos.
